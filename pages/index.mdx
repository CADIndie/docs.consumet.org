# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Consumet - a collection of high-level, search engine APIs that provide accurate information about numerous entertainment mediums (such as anime, manga, light novels, movies etc.), along with links to stream these contents from publicly-available online sources. This website intends to inform you about how to use both the API ([https://api.consumet.org](https://api.consumet.org)) and the TypeScript library ([@consumet/extensions](https://github.com/consumet/consumet.ts)).
